        ## Important: Read First
        - We only accept tests on major release and not nightly build. For Example: 0.6.0 and not 0.6.1 WIP
        - Only test games or homebrew made for the PlayStation 4. You can find a list of games here: https://www.serialstation.com/games/
        - By opening a new topic, you affirm that you have checked that it has not already been tested.
        - You must own your game, it must come from your own dump.
        - Your game dump must be unmodified, and you must not enable any game patches.
        - Make sure your log is set to "sync" and not "async".
